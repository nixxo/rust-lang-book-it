error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:6:16
  |
3 |     let s1 = String::from("hello");
  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
4 |     let s2 = s1;
  |              -- value moved here
5 |
6 |     println!("{s1}, world!");
  |                ^^ value borrowed here after move
  |
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable

4 |     let s2 = s1.clone();
